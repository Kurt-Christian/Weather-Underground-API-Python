# Weather-Underground-API-
Ahoy.  This little ditty was put together in order to tinker with the wonderful Weather Underground API.  There are many more types of calls which can be made to WU - main calls I made were to get the current temperatures along with the current sky activity, and hourly temperatures and sky activity.  I will be using the Python and C code on an Arduino Yun (Python on linino side, and C on the Arduino Atmel32 processor).  Python will be used to pull the data from the Weather Underground API, which will then be accessed by C code on the Arduino processor.  The Arduino Yun will be hooked up to a neopixel strand of RGB LEDS which will be placed behind cutouts of weather icons (sun, cloud, rainy cloud, scale for temperatures, etc.) which will be lit up accordingly.  Thus giving me a nice little weather pane/box to hang on my wall to check the current and upcoming weather conditions.
